# Supervisor Baseline Training Guide

> **Purpose**: Train supervisors on collecting accurate baseline data before QuarryCMMS pilot launch. Good baseline data = accurate ROI calculation = justified investment.

## Why Baseline Measurement Matters

### The Problem We're Solving

Before we can prove QuarryCMMS improves operations, we need to know where we started. Without baseline data:

- "It feels faster" isn't convincing to management
- Can't calculate actual dollar savings
- No way to justify the investment
- Can't identify if the app is actually helping

### What We're Measuring

| Metric | Why It Matters |
|--------|---------------|
| **Unplanned downtime** | Direct cost - equipment not producing |
| **Work order completion time** | Labor efficiency |
| **Duplicate work requests** | Wasted effort, confusion |
| **Lost/forgotten requests** | Work falling through cracks |
| **Paperwork time** | Admin burden on technicians |

### Two-Week Period

We're collecting data for **two full weeks** before app launch:
- Week 1: Getting the hang of tracking
- Week 2: Refined, accurate data

Both weeks count toward our baseline average.

## Your Role as Supervisor

### Daily Tasks

1. **Remind technicians** to fill out forms immediately (not end of day)
2. **Spot-check forms** for completeness
3. **Answer questions** about what counts as downtime

### Weekly Tasks

1. **Collect all forms** from technicians
2. **Verify calculations** are correct
3. **Complete Weekly Summary** template
4. **Submit to Site Manager** by Monday

## Form-by-Form Guide

### 1. Downtime Tracking Form

**Who fills it out**: Technician who responds to the breakdown

**When to fill it out**: Immediately when equipment goes down, then complete when fixed

**Common Mistakes to Watch For**:

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Correct Approach |
|---------|---------------|------------------|
| Forgetting small events | "It was only 20 minutes" | All events count - small ones add up |
| Rounding times | "About 10am" | Record actual: "10:07 AM" |
| Not recording travel | Parts run to town | Include all time equipment was down |
| Leaving forms at home | Forgot to bring it | Keep extra blank forms in shop |

**Verifying Forms**:
- [ ] Times make sense (up time after down time)
- [ ] Duration calculated correctly
- [ ] Cause checkbox selected
- [ ] Work performed described
- [ ] Technician signed

### 2. Work Order Log Form

**Who fills it out**: Whoever creates work orders (could be supervisor, lead tech, or control room)

**When to fill it out**: As each work order is created, then updated when completed

**Common Mistakes to Watch For**:

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Correct Approach |
|---------|---------------|------------------|
| Not logging verbal requests | "He just told me" | All work requests count |
| Forgetting to mark duplicates | Multiple people report same issue | Ask: "Was this already reported?" |
| Not tracking open WOs | "It's not done yet" | Log it, leave completion blank |
| Missing WO numbers | "We don't use numbers" | Create your own: BL-001, BL-002 |

**Verifying Forms**:
- [ ] All WOs have creation date/time
- [ ] Completed WOs have completion date/time
- [ ] Duration calculated for completed WOs
- [ ] Duplicates marked clearly

### 3. Weekly Summary Template

**Who fills it out**: Supervisor

**When to fill it out**: End of day Friday or Monday morning

**Step-by-Step**:

1. **Gather all Downtime Forms**
   - Count total events
   - Sum all hours (add up each duration)
   - Find longest event

2. **Gather all Work Order Logs**
   - Count created vs completed
   - Calculate average completion time
   - Count duplicates

3. **Add labor info**
   - Total tech hours worked (from timesheets)
   - Estimate paperwork time (ask technicians)

4. **Write observations**
   - What went wrong this week?
   - Any communication breakdowns?

## Quality Checks

### During the Week

**Ask technicians**:
- "Did anything break today that's not on your form?"
- "Any work requests come in verbally that you didn't log?"

**Look for missing data**:
- Equipment was clearly down but no form
- Work was done but no WO logged

### Before Submitting Weekly Summary

```
Checklist:
[ ] All Downtime Forms collected
[ ] All Work Order Logs collected
[ ] Totals match when double-checked
[ ] No blank required fields
[ ] Signatures complete
[ ] Observations written
```

## Common Questions

### Q: What if equipment is down overnight?

**A**: Leave "Up at" blank at end of shift. Next shift completes the form. Total duration spans the full downtime.

### Q: What if same equipment breaks twice in one day?

**A**: Two separate events on the form. Each breakdown gets its own entry.

### Q: What counts as a "work order"?

**A**: Any request for maintenance work, whether:
- Written on paper
- Called in on radio
- Sent via text
- Told verbally

If someone asked for work to be done, log it.

### Q: What if we normally don't track this stuff?

**A**: That's exactly why we're doing baseline measurement! The fact that it's hard to track is part of what QuarryCMMS will fix.

### Q: How accurate does it need to be?

**A**: Best effort with actual times. Don't guess "about 2 hours" - check the clock. But don't stress if you miss 5 minutes here or there.

### Q: What if technicians complain about paperwork?

**A**: Remind them:
1. It's only 2 weeks
2. This proves value of the new app
3. The app will eliminate most of this paperwork

## What Happens with This Data

### Week 3-4: App Launches

Technicians start using QuarryCMMS instead of paper forms.

### Day 30, 45, 60: Comparison

We pull reports from the app showing:
- Downtime captured
- WO completion times
- Zero duplicates (app prevents them)

### ROI Calculation

Compare baseline vs app data:

```
Baseline (paper):
- 40 hours downtime/week
- 8 hour avg WO completion
- 5 duplicate WOs/week

With App:
- 35 hours downtime/week (better visibility)
- 6 hour avg WO completion (faster)
- 0 duplicate WOs (app prevents)

Savings:
- 5 hours downtime x $500/hour = $2,500/week
- Plus labor efficiency gains
```

| Tomorrow | Baseline Week 1 begins |
| End of Week 1 | Collect forms, complete summary |
| Week 2 | Continue tracking |
| End of Week 2 | Collect forms, complete summary |
| Week 3 | App pilot begins! |

## Quick Reference

### Downtime = Equipment Can't Do Its Job

**YES**: Won't start, emergency stop, reduced capacity, waiting for parts

**NO**: Scheduled PM, shift change, weather, lunch break

### Work Order = Someone Asked for Work

**YES**: Paper request, radio call, verbal ask, text message

**NO**: Routine rounds, scheduled PM (unless it generates reactive work)

### Duplicate = Same Problem, Multiple Reports

**YES**: Two people called in the same breakdown

**NO**: Similar problems on different equipment
