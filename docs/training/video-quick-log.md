- Add voice notes for hands-free documentation
- Verify the entry synced successfully

## Scene 1: When to Use Quick Log (0:00 - 1:00)

### Visual
- Split screen comparison:
  - Left: Quick Log icon with "Emergency/Unplanned" label
  - Right: Work Orders icon with "Assigned Tasks" label
- Example scenarios appearing as bullet points

### Narration
"Quick Log is for when you fix something right now and need to record it fast. Use it when:

- You noticed a problem and fixed it on the spot
- There wasn't a work order for it
- You did a quick adjustment or temporary repair
- You want to document something you observed

Don't use Quick Log for assigned work orders - those have their own workflow with timers and signatures.

Think of Quick Log as your maintenance notebook. Something happens, you fix it, you log it. Simple."

### Key Points
- Quick Log = unplanned, immediate fixes
- Work Orders = assigned tasks with tracking
- Quick Log is fast - under 60 seconds

### Examples to Show
- "Tightened a loose belt"
- "Added grease to bearing"
- "Replaced a broken light bulb"
- "Found and reported a leak"

## Scene 2: Creating a Quick Log Entry (1:00 - 3:00)

### Visual
- Home screen with Quick Log button highlighted
- Tap Quick Log button
- Equipment selection screen appears
- Search for equipment
- Tap to select equipment
- Action type selection screen
- Select action type
- Notes field appears
- Add optional text notes
- Tap Submit

### Narration
"Here's how to create a Quick Log entry. From the Home screen, tap the Quick Log button - it's the lightning bolt icon.

First, select the equipment you worked on. You can scroll through the list or use the search bar. Type the first few letters of the equipment name or number.

Tap on the equipment to select it.

Next, choose what type of action you took:
- 'Replaced Part' if you swapped something out
- 'Made Adjustment' for tightening, calibrating, or tuning
- 'Temporary Fix' if it's a band-aid solution that needs follow-up
- 'Inspection Only' if you just checked and documented something

Now you can add notes. This is optional, but recommended. Type a quick description - just a sentence or two is fine. What did you do? What did you find?

When you're ready, tap Submit. That's it - you're done. The app saves it locally and syncs when you have a connection."

### Key Points
- Search makes equipment selection fast
- Four action types cover most situations
- Notes are optional but helpful
- Submit saves immediately

### Tips to Include
- Use equipment number for faster search
- "Temporary Fix" automatically flags for supervisor review

## Scene 3: Adding Voice Notes (3:00 - 4:15)

### Visual
- Quick Log screen with voice note button highlighted
- Tap and hold the microphone button
- Recording indicator appears (waveform animation)
- Speak into phone
- Release button
- Playback option appears
- Submit with voice note attached

### Narration
"Voice notes are perfect when you're wearing gloves or don't have time to type.

To record a voice note, tap and hold the microphone button. You'll see a recording indicator - this means it's listening.

Speak clearly and describe what you did. For example: 'Replaced the drive belt on crusher number two. Belt was showing signs of wear and cracking. Installed new belt from stock, tensioned to spec.'

When you're done, release the button. You can tap play to review it, or just submit.

Voice notes are saved with your entry and transcribed later when they sync. Keep them under two minutes.

A few tips for good voice notes:
- Hold the phone about six to twelve inches from your mouth
- Speak at a normal pace
- Say what you did, not just what you saw
- Include part numbers if you replaced something"

### Key Points
- Tap and hold to record
- Release to stop
- Keep under 2 minutes
- Transcribed after sync

### Tips to Include
- Works great with gloves
- Background noise is okay - app filters it
- Speak action first, then details

## Scene 4: Review and Sync (4:15 - 5:00)

### Visual
- Return to Home screen
- Sync status showing "1 pending change"
- Pull down to refresh
- Status changes to syncing, then green
- Navigate to Work Orders > Recent to see logged entry
- Entry appears in list

### Narration
"After you submit, check the sync status on your Home screen. If you see 'pending changes', your Quick Log is saved locally and waiting to sync.

Pull down to refresh if you want to sync right away. When the status turns green, your entry is in the system and visible to supervisors.

You can see your recent Quick Logs by going to Work Orders and filtering by 'My Recent' or 'Quick Logs'. Your entries appear as completed work orders - they're part of the maintenance record now.

That's all there is to Quick Log. Find equipment, choose what you did, add notes or a voice memo, and submit. Fast, simple, and it keeps the records complete.

Thanks for watching."

### Key Points
- Check sync status after submitting
- Pull down to force sync
- Quick Logs appear in work order history
- Supervisors can see and review entries
