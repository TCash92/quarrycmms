## Scene 1: Introduction & App Overview (0:00 - 2:00)

### Visual
- QuarryCMMS logo animation
- Device showing app icon on home screen
- Split screen: App features overview

### Narration
"Welcome to QuarryCMMS, your mobile maintenance management system. This app helps you track work orders, log repairs, and keep maintenance records - even when you don't have internet access.

In this video, you'll learn how to use the app for your daily work. Everything you enter is saved on your phone first, then syncs to the office when you have a connection. So don't worry about losing data - the app has you covered.

Let's get started by logging in."

### Key Points
- Works offline - data is safe
- Syncs automatically when online
- Designed for field use with gloves

---

## Scene 2: Logging In (2:00 - 4:00)

### Visual
- Login screen with email and password fields
- Keyboard appearing, credential entry
- Loading indicator, then Home screen appears
- Highlight the "Remember me" option

### Narration
"When you open the app, you'll see the login screen. Enter the email address and password that IT gave you. If you're on your own device, tap 'Remember me' so you don't have to enter your password every time.

Tap 'Sign In' and wait for the app to load. The first time you log in, the app downloads your site's equipment list and any work orders assigned to you. This might take a minute or two.

Once you're in, you'll see the Home screen. Let me show you around."

### Key Points
- Use credentials from IT
- First login takes longer (downloading data)
- "Remember me" saves time on personal devices

### Tips to Include
- If you forget your password, contact IT - there's no self-service reset yet
- Don't share your login with others

---

## Scene 3: Home Screen & Navigation (4:00 - 6:00)

### Visual
- Home screen with greeting, sync status, and quick stats
- Highlight each navigation element
- Show bottom tab bar: Home, Work Orders, Assets, Settings
- Tap through each tab briefly

### Narration
"This is your Home screen. At the top, you'll see a greeting with your name and role. Below that is the sync status - we'll talk more about that later.

The Quick Stats section shows a summary of your work: open work orders, items assigned to you, and what's due today.

At the bottom of the screen is the navigation bar. You have four tabs:
- Home brings you back here
- Work Orders shows all your assigned tasks
- Assets lets you browse equipment at your site
- Settings is where you find help and account options

The most important button is right here on the Home screen - the Quick Log button. Use this when you've fixed something on the spot and need to record it quickly. We'll cover that in a separate video.

For now, let's look at your work orders."

### Key Points
- Sync status is always visible
- Four main tabs for navigation
- Quick Log button for emergency repairs

## Scene 4: Viewing Work Orders (6:00 - 9:00)

### Visual

- Tap on a work order to open details
- Scroll through work order detail screen

### Narration
"Tap the Work Orders tab to see your tasks. By default, you'll see all open work orders for your site. Use the filters at the top to narrow it down.

Tap 'My Assigned' to see only the work orders specifically assigned to you. This is probably where you'll spend most of your time.

Each work order shows the title, the equipment it's for, the priority level, and when it's due. Red means high priority or emergency. Yellow means it's due soon.

Tap on any work order to see the full details. Here you can see:
- The complete description of what needs to be done
- Which piece of equipment this is for
- Any notes from the supervisor
- Photos or attachments if there are any

When you're ready to start working, tap the blue 'Start Work' button. But first, let me explain what happens when you do."

### Key Points

## Scene 5: Completing a Work Order (9:00 - 13:00)

- Timer appears and starts counting
- Show work being done (montage/illustration)
- Tap "Complete" button
- Completion form appears
- Fill in completion notes
- Add a photo
- Signature capture screen
- Sign with finger
- Confirmation screen

### Narration
"When you tap 'Start Work', the timer begins. This tracks how long you spend on the job. Don't worry if you need to take a break or your screen turns off - the timer automatically pauses after 5 minutes of inactivity. When you unlock your phone, it'll ask if you want to resume the timer.

Now go do the work. When you're finished, come back to the app and tap 'Complete'.

The completion form asks a few questions:

First, what type of issue was it? Was something worn out, did it break, or was this just a routine check? Pick the one that fits best.

Next, add your notes. Describe what you did. You can type, or tap the microphone button and record a voice note instead. Voice notes are great when you're wearing gloves.

If you replaced a part, take a photo showing the old and new parts. Tap 'Add Photo' and either take a new picture or choose one from your gallery.

Finally, you need to sign. This is your electronic signature confirming the work is complete. Draw your signature with your finger on the screen. Don't worry about making it perfect - just make it consistent with how you normally sign.

Once you sign, the work order is complete. The app saves everything and will sync it to the office when you have a connection."

### Key Points
- Timer tracks work duration automatically
- Timer pauses when screen is off
- Must sign to complete - this is your verification
- Voice notes work great with gloves
- Photos help document the work

### Warning to Include
"Once you sign, you cannot change the completion notes or time. Make sure everything is correct before signing."

## Scene 6: Understanding Sync Status (13:00 - 15:00)

### Visual
- Return to Home screen
- Zoom in on sync status indicator
- Show each status color with explanation
- Demonstrate pull-to-refresh
- Show "pending changes" count
- Tap sync status to see details

### Narration
"Let's talk about the sync status - that colored indicator at the top of your Home screen.

Green means everything is synced. Your data is safely in the cloud and the office can see it.

Yellow means the app is syncing right now, or you have changes waiting to sync. This is normal when you're working.

Orange means you're offline. Don't worry - the app saves everything locally. When you get back online, it'll sync automatically.

Red means there's an error. Tap on the status to see what's wrong and how to fix it.

If you see 'pending changes' with a number, that's how many items are waiting to sync. Once you're on WiFi or have good cellular, they'll upload automatically.

You can also pull down on the screen to force a refresh. This is helpful if you just finished a work order and want to make sure it synced.

If sync isn't working, go to Settings, then Help, then View Sync Details. This shows you exactly what's blocking and usually offers a solution."

### Key Points
- Green = synced, you're good
- Yellow = syncing in progress
- Orange = offline (data is safe)
- Red = error (tap for help)
- Pull down to force refresh

### Tips to Include
- Sync works best on WiFi
- Large photos sync when on WiFi to save your data plan

If you're really stuck, export your diagnostic logs and send them to IT. They can usually figure out the problem quickly.

You're now ready to use QuarryCMMS. Remember: your data is always safe, the app works offline, and help is just a tap away.

Thanks for watching, and good luck out there."
